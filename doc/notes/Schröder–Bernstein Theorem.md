# Schröder–Bernstein Theorem

**Theorem.** Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Assume there exists an injection mapping from $A$ to $B$ and there exists an injection mapping from $B$ to $A$. Then there exists a bijection mapping $A$ to $B$.

**Proof.** Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$ be injections. Let $h = g \circ f$.
