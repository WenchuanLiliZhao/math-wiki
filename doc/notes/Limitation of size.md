# Limitation of size

$C$ is a proper class iff there exists an injection $f$ mapping from $\mathscr U$ to $C$, where $\mathscr U$ is the class of all sets.

Some authors refer $f$ as a bijection. But this is redundant. Since the existence of bijections between $\mathscr U$ and $C$ follows from [[Schröder–Bernstein Theorem|Schröder–Bernstein theorem]].

Given the axiom of limitation of size, the the axiom of union, replacement and global choice are redundant since they can be derive via the limitation of size.
